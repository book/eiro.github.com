% homepages are useless

welcome anyway :). yet another useless homepage powered by

* [pandoc](http://johnmacfarlane.net/pandoc/)
* [make](http://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/000095399/utilities/make.html) (i seriously considering switching to mk from [the 9base](http://tools.suckless.org/9base))
* [git](https://git.wiki.kernel.org)

and generously hosted by [github](http://github.com).

those are my notes about current works.
