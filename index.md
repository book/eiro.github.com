this one is generously hosted by [github](http://github.com)
powered by simple tools (like _PANDOC, _M4, _ZSH, _MAKE, and very few lines of
_PERL and _PERL6)

[pandoc](http://pandoc.org) and driven by
[a Makefile](https://github.com/eiro/eiro.github.com/blob/master/Makefile).

More about "how" in the [readme](readme.html)(including todo list).

You can be involved reading [the atom](atom.xml).
