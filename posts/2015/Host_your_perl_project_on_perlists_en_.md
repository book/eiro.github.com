# Host your perl project on perlists (en)

In order to support the Perl community, the 
french "Research and Education Network" ([RENATER](http://renater.fr))
hosts [Perlists](https://groups.perlists.pm/sympa), 
a free mailing list infrastructure based on 
[Sympa](http://www.sympa.org). [London.pm](http://london.pm/)
recently moved their lists on it and you should do the same if you need a free, 
simple and powerfull way to manage mailing lists and working groups for a perl
related project.

Any Perl-related community, monger group or software project is welcome to
create mailing lists on this server so you will be able to, from a simple web
interace:

- create and manage lists and subscriptions,
- configure and customize lists using the many parameters available
- and much more! (David Verdin (lead developer) gave a talk about all the
  sympa features at [YAPC::Europe 2014](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-JMg1wdYdOU) (en) and 
  [FPW 2013](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q70XBXZ8yE8) (fr)). Sympa is much
  more than a list manager and provides basic groupware system.

Sympa is written in [perl](http://www.perl.org) and supported by
[RENATER](http://renater.fr), its community is very welcoming and the user base
is very large: 90% of the french universities, organizations like UNESCO, NASA, ...
it is designed for very large infrastructures and usages. 

The project is as active as it can with a very small team, you can see the
[news from 6.2 version](http://www.sympa.org/distribution/latest-unstable/NEWS) and the
[ambitious 7.0 roadmap](https://www.sympa.org/dev/project_direction). Every contributor is
welcome!

Any questions about [Perlists](https://groups.perlists.pm/sympa)
or [sympa](http://www.sympa.org)? please ask [the sysops](mailto:listmaster@groups.perlists.pm).

See you on perlists!
