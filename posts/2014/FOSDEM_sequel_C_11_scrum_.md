% FOSDEM sequel: C++11, scrum, ...

Once again, i came to [FOSDEM](https://fosdem.org/2014/) with some talks in
mind, missed them and learnt a lot of new, completly different things.

Once again, FOSDEM is the echo of my internet feeds (at this point, the cultural spectrum 
of the people i spoke to is too large to just say we're reading the same blogs).

* the rise of the functionnal programming for the masses 
* the rise of the "let's fire all managers" movement (coming from both
  scrum and open source as "working models")

The big surprise for me is a very interesting discution about the modern paradigms of C++.
I realized i was acting like the "perl is dead" people: comparing C++ from nineties to the 
very last features of the langages i use daily: I was not unfair, just ignorant.

So i began to read the C++ posts again and seen
[this article](http://nathan.ca/2014/02/type-rich-programming/) pointing on 
[Bjarne Stroustrup: C++11 Style](http://channel9.msdn.com/Events/GoingNative/GoingNative-2012/Keynote-Bjarne-Stroustrup-Cpp11-Style) 
which is a very interesting talk about what the "good C++" should be.
