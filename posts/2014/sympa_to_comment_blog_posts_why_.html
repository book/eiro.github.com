<div class="grid-80"><h1>sympa to comment blog posts: why ?</h1><section><p>I maintain websites since 1997 and my motto always was &quot;as static as possible&quot;. I run my own &quot;static web&quot; engines, used open source ones and ended with <a href="#adieu-jekyll-i-dumped-you-for-a-28-lines-makefile">a simple <code>Makefile</code></a>.</p>
<p>The very important missing part was blog comments but it's not only about serving static pages: we're in year 2014 and still, the web failed to provide tools that can approach the productivity of mutt when it comes to share thoughts about a post: editing in textareas, navigating in the thread, tagging, archiving, ... all those basics are just jokes in a webpages! Trying to compare wikis to just editing files in your filesystem (then share them with git, rsync, seafile, whatever ..) also is.</p>
<p>But i didn't carre for a while because i had a bigger plan (my beloved <code>mindpipe</code>) so asked commenters to send me mails instead of expecting a &quot;comment&quot; textarea. I miss <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Usenet">usenet</a>.</p>
<p>Years ago, i came at a <a href="http://journeesperl.fr/">French Perl Workshop</a> and spoke about a subset of what mindpipe could be. Then i learnt (thanks to <a href="http://philippe.bruhat.net/">BooK</a> and <a href="http://lumberjaph.net/">Franck</a>) about <a href="http://disqus.com/">disqus</a>. i also was aware of <a href="http://gmane.org/">gname</a>.</p>
<p>Finally, i'm now convinced that the technical roots of mindpipe was invented in a 80's OS named <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plan_9_from_Bell_Labs">Plan9</a>. What i want is just piping, copying and editing <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/9P">9p</a> served files thru <a href="http://www.vim.org">vim</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acme_(editor)">acme</a>) or emacs.</p>
<p>I know web browsers are bloated enough to serve as a base of very handy editing application (cloud9 or etherpad are some moving tries to render edited content in a web page) but they need a 9p support (maybe <a href="https://github.com/mozilla/servo/">servo</a> could have one?) and i think plan9 ideas are finally spreading (i remember how sarcatic were people about linux or open source just ten years ago, they just heard about it).</p>
<p>Nevertheless: ten years later, mindpipe is still just an idea and i changed my mind about doing software. I really think that</p>
<ul>
<li>nothing is perfect</li>
<li>starting small is better than not starting at all</li>
<li>the best code is the one you don't have to write</li>
</ul>
<p>thinking the unix way: what is the best tool to provide simple ways to</p>
<ul>
<li>subscribe a discutions that can be seen as emails?</li>
<li>make discutions and archives public, private, moderated?</li>
<li>avoid spams and robots using bayesians and sending scenaries to check the validity of your posts?</li>
</ul>
<p>I i need a battle tested, highly configurable and extendable but just a &quot;mailing list manager&quot;! I know it's not perfect but it's way better than running yet another anoying web forum.</p>
<p>And i know the beast: <a href="http://www.sympa.org">sympa</a> is way the best mailing list manager i ever seen. Yes, i have tons of grievances about it but in the end, it's much more superior than everything i saw and is in a constant evolution since 1996 (AFAIK). Plus: it's written in <a href="http://www.perl.org">Perl</a>! not a so modern one but you don't carre if you just have to write plugins.</p><span class="dynamic-px-width"></span></section></div>
