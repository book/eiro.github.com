% hacking on my blog again

as i have nothing to report to the perl community this year, nothing happened
to "please ironman" (as i wrote in a
[previous post](http://eiro.github.com/posts/2014/eiro-brain-dump_to_please_ironman.html)).

Things could change quickly (i'll be able to hack on [sympa](http://sympa.org/) next week) so i just wrote a
m4 powered kludge to be sure my new plan will work.  I had no time for the
"testing on local instance part" but hey! if you read this throught Ironman, it
worked.
