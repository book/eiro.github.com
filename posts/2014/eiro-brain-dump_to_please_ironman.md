% eiro-brain-dump to please ironman

some days ago, i had a chat on [epo](http://www.enlightenedperl.org/)@[freenode](http://freenode.net/)
because [my atom](/atom.xml) is completly ignored by [ironman planet](http://ironman.enlightenedperl.org/).
this post is a reminder.

[Ironman planet](http://ironman.enlightenedperl.org/) expects each entries to provide
an alternate html address (which wasn't my initial plan but after all: every text
can be rendered as html).

So the plan is 

* fix [eiro-brain-dump](http://eiro.github.io) to make it ironman compliant (i still have to decide how). 
* install a local ironman and provide a patch to show error reports when you update your feed
  (so you can fix your stuff without disturbing EPO people)

this was an excuse create a profile on [questhub.io](https://questhub.io/)
and create a [related quest](https://questhub.io/realm/perl/quest/531f0d326e78176e6a0000bd).
