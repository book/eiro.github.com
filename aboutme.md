% About me

As we all have to introduce ourselves when we join a community, i was bored of
copy/pasting or very incomplete presentations so this page is my clipboard.

I'm always ready to speak of one of those topics or 

# My live
 
* I live at Strasbourg, France (very close to a decent country)
* I work as product manager at the local University
* I have children (since 2003 and 2004)
* I'm "ethical vegetarian" since 2008, wannabe vegan and activist at some point.
* I am linux used and member of OSS community since circa 1995 (both for
  ethical and technical reasons)

# as member of the OSS community

I'm an open source contributor, mainly by providing patches and bugs
in various projects i use (i was payed for those in koha and sympa).

I authored and i maintain some modules on CPAN, wrote cpan2port, have some
projects on github.

Vice-president of the "Mongueurs de Perl", I'm also involved in the OSS events
(as organizer or/and speaker).

about Perl, Unix and acmeism at

* Rencontres mondiales du logiciel libre (2009)
* German Perl Workshop (2011?)
* Belgium Perl Workshop (2011?)
* French Perl Workshop (2009,...,2015)
* Fosdem (2012)
* PyconFr (2012,2013)
* YAPC::Europe (2011,2012)

# my programming journey

* started learning with logo and basic (circa 1984)
* made my first "real programs" with pascal and C (circa 1990),
  loved C
* started unix installing my first linux (circa 1995), felt in love with
  unix toolchain (shell, filters, vi, make, ...)
* discover perl one year later, felt in love again
* the rise of other dynamic langages (beginning of the 2000 years) made me give
  a try to ruby, python or lua which are actually simpler to understand if you
  come from java. i didn't and even if there are some features i really liked in ruby,
  missing the power of Perl frustated me very fast. 
* also, i tried Haskell and other functionnal programming at the end of this decade.
  it made me really jalous of people who wasn't brain-damaged by the paradigms we use
  but at the end of the day, i'm not productive enought with those langages.
* i was a cat-v lurker so i saw go coming, wrote some code and where quicky
  boring by the moto "error are just values". This may seem to be a detail but
  error handling is spend a lot of time on, right?

my future is about Perl (5 and 6) and exploring a way to develop web apps
without loosing my mind.

# the tools i use

daily user of zsh, perl, debian (stable and unstable), vim (as much more than an editor).
fan of suckless technologies for myself and GNOME for the end-users.
