I consider myself as an open source veteran now (first steps in 1997) and
FOSDEM gives me the opportunity to meet a lot of hackers i work with at work
or on personnal projects. I really enjoy it and the only thing i miss is a
place to hack (something with power supply and whiteboard) but i imagine it's
quiet hard to set up.

I enjoy it every time but never blogged about it. This year had a special
story: first, the Perl devroom was denied by the FOSDEM organizers. The Jan
25th, Claudio sent [a
CFP](http://nxadm.wordpress.com/2013/01/25/perlfosdem2013-a-very-late-call-for-papers/)
which was heavily relayed by the community (an agregator failure wasn't an
excuse: i recieved it by mail, facebook, twitter, irc, â€¦). In only *8 hours*,
Wendy and Claudio set a schedule up with very interesting talks and extra
backup speakers. The room was full during the talks i attended.

This is something i really like in this community: we're very connected, we
know each others, we are motivated and we can achieve this kind of things.
Thank you Claudio and Wendy to make it so obvious!

About the FOSDEM people: what the heck is going on? I just don't get the point
of denying such a cloudy devroom as the perl one is for many years. If someone
have a decent theory: please share!
