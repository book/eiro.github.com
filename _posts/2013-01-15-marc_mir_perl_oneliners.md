While sed and awk are still worth to know for basic tasks, at some points the
way perl superseded them is awesome. even if i'm a great zsh fan,
[Perlude](https://metacpan.org/release/perlude) and
[Perlude::Sh](https://metacpan.org/release/perlude-sh), replaced it for all the
sysop scripting purposes. Also, some perl tools like
[ack](http://betterthangrep.com/) or [p](https://metacpan.org/module/App::p)
can be very usefull in interactive maner.

But today i'll focus on library sciences problems (aka
[perl4lib](http://perl4lib.perl.org/)). As clever as it was when it was invented (44 years ago), it's a shame the MARC format and its stone-aged standard serialization ()

you really should have a look on
[perlrun documentation](http://perldoc.perl.org/perlrun.html) if you didn't.

Today i'll talk about how i use perl, xxd and vim to debug some
