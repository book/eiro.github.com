It will be the 1st anniversary of my [Linkfluence](http://linkfluence.net)
departure in few days.  I miss them a lot! Not only the geek factor (they all
are clever people working on an awesome project) but the high quality
management based on respect and confidence. They deserve their success and i'm
really gratefull to Camille (the CTO) to had give me the chance to be a part of
it.

Now i'm back to the [Strasbourg University](http://unistra.fr), working on cool
projects on library sciences and the evolution of an huge information system.
it please me daily as well.

After more than a year without a post, it's time to come back to the
blogosphere: i have a brunch of technical posts i really want to share. As i
have no time to make wwk evolve, I finally fall back to run this blog with
jekyll just because i can host my pages on github very quickly using [Jekyll
Bootstrap](http://jekyllbootstrap.com/).
